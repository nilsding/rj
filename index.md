# rq

rq is a Ruby command-line JSON processor.  It's somewhat like [jq], except
that you write your expressions in pure Ruby.

rq is a standalone binary, you don't need to have Ruby installed on your
system.  This is possible thanks to the [mruby] project.

If you're already familiar with Ruby there is no need to learn a completely
new language.
